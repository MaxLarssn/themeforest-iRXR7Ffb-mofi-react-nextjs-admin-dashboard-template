  <li>First and foremost, Bootstrap is easy to learn. Due to its popularity, plenty of tutorials and online forums are available to help you get started.</li>
  <li>One of the reasons why Bootstrap is so popular among web developers and web designers is that it has a simple file structure. Its files are compiled for easy access, and it only requires basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS to modify them.</li>
  <li>You can also use themes for popular content management systems as learning tools. For example, most WordPress themes were developed using Bootstrap, which any beginner web developer can access. </li>
  <li>To increase the site's page load time, Bootstrap minifies the CSS and JavaScript files. Additionally, Bootstrap maintains consistency across the syntax between websites and developers, which is ideal for team-based projects.</li>

 <li>Bootstrap handles the image display and responsiveness with its predefined HTML and CSS rules.</li>
 <li>Adding the .img-responsive class will automatically resize images based on the users' screen size. This will benefit your websiteâ€™s performance, as reducing image sizes is part of the site optimization process.</li>
 <li>Bootstrap also provides additional classes like .img-circle and .img-rounded, which help to modify the images' shape.</li>
